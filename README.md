# Project SG

## Running
```
$ NODE_ENV=development npm run build && npm run start
```


## Todo
* Backfill history so when you start the game there's a graph
* Select stock to show graph
* Better random walk simulation
* Game simulation pause
* Make time fake - don't track current time, rather use tick count plus start time
